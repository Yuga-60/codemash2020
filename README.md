### [API Gateways and Microservices: 2 peas in a pod](https://www.codemash.org/session-details?id=144597)

Chances are you’ve already gone through the tedious process of decomposing your monolith into microservices, or at the very least, want to use microservices in the near future. Nowadays, microservices connect to various APIs. These APIs could differ in protocols (REST/SOAP), where they’re hosted (on-prem/cloud), security (tokens/JWTs) and so on.

Learn how to leverage API Gateways so your microservices are able to fully connect and harness the power of these APIs. This talk will go into details on various API Gateway offerings and a decision matrix on which one to pick. The talk will also highlight the various features of API Gateways like productizing APIs, creating users and subscriptions, security, error handling, rate limiting. We will use Azure API Management to display the awesome power of API Gateways but the principles will be universal.
